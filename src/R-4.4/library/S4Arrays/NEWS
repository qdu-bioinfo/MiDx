VERSION 1.6.0
-------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Add fast colsum() method for ordinary matrices.

    o Define low-level generics:
        - subset_Array_by_logical_array()
        - subset_Array_by_Lindex()
        - subset_Array_by_Mindex()
        - subset_Array_by_Nindex()
      with default methods. Their purpose is to support subsetting (`[`)
      of Array derivatives and to make it easier for developers of Array
      extensions to implement subsetting for their objects.
      They are not intended to be used directly by the end user.

    o Define low-level generics:
        - subassign_Array_by_logical_array()
        - subassign_Array_by_Lindex()
        - subassign_Array_by_Mindex()
        - subassign_Array_by_Nindex()
      with default methods. Their purpose is to support subassignment (`[<-`)
      of Array derivatives and to make it easier for developers of Array
      extensions to implement subassignment for their objects.
      They are not intended to be used directly by the end user.

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o read_block() now uses SparseArray::extract_sparse_array() instead of
      DelayedArray::OLD_extract_sparse_array() behind the scene to extract
      and load sparse blocks from a sparse array-like object. As a consequence,
      sparse blocks are now returned as SparseArray objects (implemented in
      the SparseArray package) instead of SparseArraySeed objects (implemented
      in the DelayedArray package).
