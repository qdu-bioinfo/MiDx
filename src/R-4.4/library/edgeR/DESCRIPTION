Title: Empirical Analysis of Digital Gene Expression Data in R
Description: Differential expression analysis of RNA-seq expression profiles with biological replication. Implements a range of statistical methodology based on the negative binomial distributions, including empirical Bayes estimation, exact tests, generalized linear models and quasi-likelihood tests. As well as RNA-seq, it be applied to differential signal analysis of other types of genomic data that produce read counts, including ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, Bisulfite-seq, SAGE and CAGE.
